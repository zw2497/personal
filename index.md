**Linux Kernel Hacking**
Operating System    
Columbia, 2018

* [Android orientation synchronization System call](https://github.com/zw2497/Android-Orientation-Synchronizer): Wrote an Android user-space daemon to pass device orientation info to kernel, used Wait Queue, Spinlock, IDR to allow multiple processes registering, destroying orientation events and getting notified when certain event happens    

* [Multi-core Weighted Round-Robin Scheduler](https://github.com/zw2497/Linux-Weight-Round-Robin-scheduler): An O (1) CPU Affinity Multicore Scheduler which supports keeping track of weight on each CPUs, idle load balancing by pulling tasks, assigned same CPU affinity on each thread groups

* [Simple Shell](https://github.com/zw2497/Linux-Simple-Shell): Implemented in C which supports built-in commands as well as `pipes, !, !string, history, chdir`

* [In-memory Proc File System](https://github.com/zw2497/Linux-Proc-File-System): Constructed a pseudo file system in Linux which can present process hierarchy in directory
